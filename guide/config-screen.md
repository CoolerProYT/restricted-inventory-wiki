# Config screen

Open the editor with:

```text
/restrictedinventory config
```

## Find a restriction

The upper panel contains two collections:

- **Items** includes registered items and the variants found in creative tabs, such as potions and enchanted books.
- **Tags** includes registered item tags and cycles through their members for the preview.

Search matches display names, registry IDs, and item tooltip text. For example, searching `sharpness` can find the corresponding enchanted book. Prefix a query with a namespace and a colon—such as `minecraft:torch`—to narrow results by mod.

Scroll with the wheel or drag the bar at the right of the list.

## Edit the slot grid

The middle panel mirrors the player's 36 inventory slots.

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Left-click an item or tag | Select it as the active restriction |
| Left-click a slot | Apply the active restriction |
| Right-click a slot | Clear the slot's restriction |
| Middle-click a filled slot | Edit its component or NBT filter |
| Hover a slot | Show its item/tag and variant filter |

Select **Save** to write and activate the rules. **Cancel** closes the editor without applying the working changes.

## Reading the preview

A filled slot in the editor cycles through valid items when its rule targets a tag. In a normal inventory, a restricted slot displays a gray ghost item so players can recognize the expected content without opening the editor.

Minecraft 1.20.1 calls variant data **NBT**. Minecraft 1.21.1 and newer use **data components**. The editor provides the same middle-click workflow on every supported branch.
