# Getting started

RestrictedInventory assigns rules to the 36 slots in a player's hotbar and main inventory. Start with the in-game editor; use the JSON files when you need to version or distribute a setup.

## Supported versions

Choose the RestrictedInventory release built for your exact Minecraft version and loader.

| Minecraft | RestrictedInventory | Java | Loaders | CoolerConfig |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1.20.1** | 20.1.7 | 17+ | Fabric, Forge | 20.1.3+ |
| **1.21.1** | 21.1.8 | 21+ | Fabric, NeoForge | 21.1.1+ |
| **26.1.2** | 26.1.2.5 | 25+ | Fabric, NeoForge | 26.1.2.29+ |
| **26.2** | 26.2.0.5 | 25+ | Fabric, NeoForge | 26.1.2.29+ |

Fabric builds also require Fabric API. The minimum Fabric Loader versions are 0.16.10 for 1.20.1, 0.18.4 for 1.21.1, 0.18.6 for 26.1.2, and 0.19.0 for 26.2. The Forge 1.20.1 build requires Forge 47.4.0 or newer; NeoForge minimums are 21.1.80, 26.1.2.75, and 26.2.0.1-beta for their matching branches.

::: warning Match both version and loader
Each Minecraft and loader combination has a different JAR. Minecraft 1.20.1 uses **Forge**; the newer non-Fabric builds use **NeoForge**.
:::

## Install

1. Stop Minecraft or the server.
2. Install the required loader and dependencies.
3. Put the RestrictedInventory JAR in the instance's `mods` folder.
4. Start the game or server once to create the JSON configuration files.

For multiplayer, install the mod and its dependencies on both the server and every connecting client. The server decides whether rules are shared or player-owned.

## Create your first rule

1. Join a world and run `/restrictedinventory config`.
2. Search for an item, or switch to the **Tags** tab.
3. Click the item or tag you want.
4. Left-click a slot in the inventory grid.
5. Select **Save**.

The selected slot now shows a ghost preview. Items that do not satisfy the rule cannot be placed there through normal inventory actions.

::: tip Find a slot number
Hold **Tab** while an inventory screen is open. With `showSlotIndex` enabled, the mod overlays the index on each player-inventory slot.
:::

## Choose the rule scope

The server's `useClientRestriction` value controls ownership:

- `false` (default): one server-wide ruleset; only administrators can edit it.
- `true`: every player manages their own ruleset and can open the editor.

Continue with the [config screen](/guide/config-screen) or go directly to the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration).
